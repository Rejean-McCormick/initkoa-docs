**Target links:** 26. Only explicitly adopted exact interface names are recorded; `TBD` requires bilateral owner agreement.

## Interpretation

Every row is scoped to a possible journey and remains `target_design_not_qualified`. For civic links, the profile name is an observed adopted identifier; the row does not assert real deployment. The currently consumed [graph registry](https://github.com/Rejean-McCormick/kOA-Digital-Ecosystem/blob/main/docs/inventory/graph-registry.v1.json) stays separate until the downstream publisher and owners agree on a migration.
