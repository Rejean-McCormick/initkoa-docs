# FC-24 — Observability, incident containment and owner recovery

**Classification:** `TARGET_DESIGN` — final-system requirement, **not proof of integration or deployment**.

**Inherits:** [System model](../00-system-model.md), [authority](../01-authority-and-ownership.md), [contracts and receipts](../02-contract-and-receipts.md), [failure rules](../03-state-trust-and-failure.md).

## Functional promise

**Owner(s):** Every product owner / platform host / independent diagnostics.

**Initiator:** An incident or a partial asynchronous effect requires bounded recovery.

**Expected result:** Owner-scoped incident trace, recovered or openly degraded state and accurate public-safe status.

## Nominal end-to-end behavior

| Step | Stage | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Detect | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 2 | correlate | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 3 | contain | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 4 | diagnose | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 5 | owner rollback/replay | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 6 | reconcile and close. | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |

## Interfaces and authority gates

**Target boundary references:** TBD per owner. These identify candidate or scoped adopted contracts; they do not certify complete multi-owner deployment. Producer disclosure and receiving-owner admission are separate decisions.

Where no exact interface is adopted, keep `TBD` rather than inventing a protocol ID. All privileged effects must be checked at the actual enforcing owner.

## Failure, privacy and forbidden shortcuts

A UI rollback cannot reverse civic history or Orgo Tasks; unknown effects remain unresolved.

Owner-specific tenant/actor identity, source classification, integrity checks, replay and correction must be preserved. No debug dashboard or public documentation site may disclose private content.

## Definition of done — acceptance and negative tests

Crash/restart, partial effect, privacy-safe log, last-known-good and stale projection tests.

To qualify the full chain, pin both producer and consumer revisions and execute negative fixtures, recovery and idempotency scenarios. An owner code snapshot alone does not demonstrate running behavior.

## Required code and contract alignment

Document correlation IDs, actual PEP control and owner recovery procedures per admitted boundary.

## Source anchors and verification boundary

See the [53-repository portfolio](../../PORTFOLIO.md) and [snapshot reconciliation](../../SNAPSHOT_RECONCILIATION.md) for source member names, hashes, declared local roots and evidence limitations. Contract boundaries are catalogued in [the C0 target ledger](../../BOUNDARIES.md). This is intended final behavior, not evidence of a currently operational multi-repository integration.
