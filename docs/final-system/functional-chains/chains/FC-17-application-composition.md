# FC-17 — Optional Koali Space app navigation

**Classification:** `TARGET_DESIGN` — final-system requirement, **not proof of integration or deployment**.

**Inherits:** [System model](../00-system-model.md), [authority](../01-authority-and-ownership.md), [contracts and receipts](../02-contract-and-receipts.md), [failure rules](../03-state-trust-and-failure.md).

## Functional promise

**Owner(s):** Koali-Spaces / product UI owners.

**Initiator:** A user enters an independently usable product via a possible shared Space.

**Expected result:** Admitted, accessible product surface with honest ready/degraded state.

## Nominal end-to-end behavior

| Step | Stage | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Discover manifest | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 2 | check allowed origin | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 3 | verify required API probes | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 4 | route UI | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 5 | recover. | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |

## Interfaces and authority gates

**Target boundary references:** B-PLAT-02. These identify candidate or scoped adopted contracts; they do not certify complete multi-owner deployment. Producer disclosure and receiving-owner admission are separate decisions.

Where no exact interface is adopted, keep `TBD` rather than inventing a protocol ID. All privileged effects must be checked at the actual enforcing owner.

## Failure, privacy and forbidden shortcuts

Space is not product-state authority; frontend-only health does not imply backend readiness.

Owner-specific tenant/actor identity, source classification, integrity checks, replay and correction must be preserved. No debug dashboard or public documentation site may disclose private content.

## Definition of done — acceptance and negative tests

Manifest denial, required-probe failure, standalone fallback and route isolation tests.

To qualify the full chain, pin both producer and consumer revisions and execute negative fixtures, recovery and idempotency scenarios. An owner code snapshot alone does not demonstrate running behavior.

## Required code and contract alignment

Version manifest/CSP/probe contracts while preserving product operation without the shell.

## Source anchors and verification boundary

See the [53-repository portfolio](../../PORTFOLIO.md) and [snapshot reconciliation](../../SNAPSHOT_RECONCILIATION.md) for source member names, hashes, declared local roots and evidence limitations. Contract boundaries are catalogued in [the C0 target ledger](../../BOUNDARIES.md). This is intended final behavior, not evidence of a currently operational multi-repository integration.
