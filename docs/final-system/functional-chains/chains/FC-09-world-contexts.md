# FC-09 — World and Universe context releases

**Classification:** `TARGET_DESIGN` — final-system requirement, **not proof of integration or deployment**.

**Inherits:** [System model](../00-system-model.md), [authority](../01-authority-and-ownership.md), [contracts and receipts](../02-contract-and-receipts.md), [failure rules](../03-state-trust-and-failure.md).

## Functional promise

**Owner(s):** Konnaxion-Worlds / Orgo-Worlds.

**Initiator:** An owner proposes a versioned context affecting a defined product and tenant.

**Expected result:** Approved owner WorldRelease with active context reference and safe rollback.

## Nominal end-to-end behavior

| Step | Stage | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define scope | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 2 | review context | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 3 | qualify version | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 4 | admit to correct app | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 5 | observe or revert. | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |

## Interfaces and authority gates

**Target boundary references:** B-CIVIC-03. These identify candidate or scoped adopted contracts; they do not certify complete multi-owner deployment. Producer disclosure and receiving-owner admission are separate decisions.

Where no exact interface is adopted, keep `TBD` rather than inventing a protocol ID. All privileged effects must be checked at the actual enforcing owner.

## Failure, privacy and forbidden shortcuts

World cannot grant global permissions; stale context must not rewrite existing Case/Decision history.

Owner-specific tenant/actor identity, source classification, integrity checks, replay and correction must be preserved. No debug dashboard or public documentation site may disclose private content.

## Definition of done — acceptance and negative tests

Wrong context/tenant and rollback tests preserve owner business state.

To qualify the full chain, pin both producer and consumer revisions and execute negative fixtures, recovery and idempotency scenarios. An owner code snapshot alone does not demonstrate running behavior.

## Required code and contract alignment

Define an additional Orgo-Worlds→Orgo owner contract before registering its new boundary.

## Source anchors and verification boundary

See the [53-repository portfolio](../../PORTFOLIO.md) and [snapshot reconciliation](../../SNAPSHOT_RECONCILIATION.md) for source member names, hashes, declared local roots and evidence limitations. Contract boundaries are catalogued in [the C0 target ledger](../../BOUNDARIES.md). This is intended final behavior, not evidence of a currently operational multi-repository integration.
