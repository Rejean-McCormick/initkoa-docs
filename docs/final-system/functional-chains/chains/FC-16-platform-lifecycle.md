# FC-16 — Build, runtime admission, deploy and rollback

**Classification:** `TARGET_DESIGN` — final-system requirement, **not proof of integration or deployment**.

**Inherits:** [System model](../00-system-model.md), [authority](../01-authority-and-ownership.md), [contracts and receipts](../02-contract-and-receipts.md), [failure rules](../03-state-trust-and-failure.md).

## Functional promise

**Owner(s):** kOA-Linux-Koali / Koali-Control-Panel / Konnaxion-Capsule-Manager.

**Initiator:** An operator requests a bounded transition of a versioned deployable artifact on an authorized host.

**Expected result:** Measured host lifecycle and recovery receipt distinct from content publication and UI activation.

## Nominal end-to-end behavior

| Step | Stage | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Build candidate | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 2 | independent assess | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 3 | authorize ReleaseSet | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 4 | host PEP | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 5 | activate | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 6 | observe/recover. | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |

## Interfaces and authority gates

**Target boundary references:** B-PLAT-01, B-PLAT-02. These identify candidate or scoped adopted contracts; they do not certify complete multi-owner deployment. Producer disclosure and receiving-owner admission are separate decisions.

Where no exact interface is adopted, keep `TBD` rather than inventing a protocol ID. All privileged effects must be checked at the actual enforcing owner.

## Failure, privacy and forbidden shortcuts

No unapproved host execution, dirty/unpinned profile, privileged credential leak or false healthy status.

Owner-specific tenant/actor identity, source classification, integrity checks, replay and correction must be preserved. No debug dashboard or public documentation site may disclose private content.

## Definition of done — acceptance and negative tests

Denied release, crash/rollback, signed artifact and host-observed health fixtures.

To qualify the full chain, pin both producer and consumer revisions and execute negative fixtures, recovery and idempotency scenarios. An owner code snapshot alone does not demonstrate running behavior.

## Required code and contract alignment

Align Control Panel request, platform admission and Capsule agent enforcement with diagnostic evidence.

## Source anchors and verification boundary

See the [53-repository portfolio](../../PORTFOLIO.md) and [snapshot reconciliation](../../SNAPSHOT_RECONCILIATION.md) for source member names, hashes, declared local roots and evidence limitations. Contract boundaries are catalogued in [the C0 target ledger](../../BOUNDARIES.md). This is intended final behavior, not evidence of a currently operational multi-repository integration.
