# FC-12 — Faithful multilingual realization and grammar runtime

**Classification:** `TARGET_DESIGN` — final-system requirement, **not proof of integration or deployment**.

**Inherits:** [System model](../00-system-model.md), [authority](../01-authority-and-ownership.md), [contracts and receipts](../02-contract-and-receipts.md), [failure rules](../03-state-trust-and-failure.md).

## Functional promise

**Owner(s):** SemantiK-Architect / SemantiK_Runtime_Orchestrator / diK.

**Initiator:** An approved typed semantic input requires a specific supported language output.

**Expected result:** Faithful language realization with RuntimeSet/locale trace or an explicit missing-language verdict.

## Nominal end-to-end behavior

| Step | Stage | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Validate input | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 2 | bind lexicon | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 3 | choose GF RuntimeSet | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 4 | independent qualify | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |
| 5 | render or fail. | Scoped owner state and evidence receipt; no hidden mutation of other systems |

## Interfaces and authority gates

**Target boundary references:** B-LANG-01. These identify candidate or scoped adopted contracts; they do not certify complete multi-owner deployment. Producer disclosure and receiving-owner admission are separate decisions.

Where no exact interface is adopted, keep `TBD` rather than inventing a protocol ID. All privileged effects must be checked at the actual enforcing owner.

## Failure, privacy and forbidden shortcuts

Missing locale, unsafe grammar profile or fabricated translation must not be silently promoted.

Owner-specific tenant/actor identity, source classification, integrity checks, replay and correction must be preserved. No debug dashboard or public documentation site may disclose private content.

## Definition of done — acceptance and negative tests

Positive/negative language fixtures, RuntimeSet rollback and unsupported-locale errors.

To qualify the full chain, pin both producer and consumer revisions and execute negative fixtures, recovery and idempotency scenarios. An owner code snapshot alone does not demonstrate running behavior.

## Required code and contract alignment

Specify exact SemantiK→Runtime Orchestrator grammar manifest and independent verifier scope.

## Source anchors and verification boundary

See the [53-repository portfolio](../../PORTFOLIO.md) and [snapshot reconciliation](../../SNAPSHOT_RECONCILIATION.md) for source member names, hashes, declared local roots and evidence limitations. Contract boundaries are catalogued in [the C0 target ledger](../../BOUNDARIES.md). This is intended final behavior, not evidence of a currently operational multi-repository integration.
